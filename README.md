# Dem Configs
Configs like tmux conf and whatnot

## `tmux.conf`
Default `tmux.conf` file just the way I like it. Good for cloning to new machines! Do not be deceived, I didn't come up with this meself. Must have cloned someone else's at some point, but I don't remember now...

## `img` Directory
These are just some images I like for backgrounds and stuff. This way I have em in one spot.
